# Scala's real world project
This notebook demonstrates a data camp project that read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub by datacamp, is comprised of three files:

1. pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.
2. pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
3. pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
